Instructions about word2vec.py

The program takes the news.crawl.gz compressed-file and build a word2vec model that can predict the similarity of two words, or give the top n similar words for a given word.

How to run it:
1. Make sure the news.crawl.gz and word2vec.py are in the same directory
2. In the terminal type: python word2vec.py

This process will take some time (5-8 minutes). The program is reading the compressed file and then it is learning the featuers for each word using a nerual network of one hidden layer.

At the end you will have two outputs:
1. the wordvectors.txt (not a utf-8 file) which contains all word vectors
2. display in the terminal of similarities for the given words
