# natural-language-processing-nlp

This repository contains 3 NLP projects I worked during spring 2021 semester. Each of the folders has an extensive `README.MD` file as well and a report file that describes each model in detail. The datasets are zipped to facilitate easy upload on GitHub, but as indicated they should be unzipped before used. Two datasets are not present, they need to be download from Google Drive. 

1. `/n-gram` project builds and validates three different n-gram models using the Markov assumption. These models are used to predict the likelihood of a sentance occuring
2. `/naive_bayes_classifier` project builds and validates a sentiment classifier using Bag of Words feature. This model predicts if a movie review is a negative or a positive review. The models has an accuracy of 81.5%
3. `/word2vec` project builds word vectors that enable us to compare similarites between words by analyzing their context

For more information on each project please read the `README.md` file or the project report.
